This is the first release of from [its own repository](https://github.com/Byron/cargo-smart-release) which for the first time comes without `git2` dependency,
and is solely powered by `gix`.

Please note that due to the rewritten history and tag-name changes, this changelog also looks quite a bit different in its historical parts.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0183d55c92dfeaff82f16d13e52fa23427d75e19/> use `crates-index` with https://github.com/frewsxcv/rust-crates-index/pull/129 applied.
   This means `git2` is now fully removed from the tools used by `gitoxide`.
   
   Note that this also means that the `vendored-ssl` feature has been removed as there is no equivalent.
   It might be worth to add feature toggles that change to another backend though.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-186ab8af0023b419e2df6aa86a102adf10c931b6/> remove `git2` dependency thanks to upgrade to latest version of `crates-index`
   Note that this also removes the `vendored-openssl` feature as it doesn't exist in `crates-index`
   anymore.

<csr-id-38e3835b1b1fb90a7596b3cb08dd18c903a5acce/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint
 - <csr-id-dbc6cbb4363c2532f81b0bd6e351c4577bb9e9a3/> inline format args

### Style (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-03c57aeb4586059a5065c56ff56044f24880af90/> rename --skip-dependencies to --no-dependencies‚Ä¶
   ‚Ä¶to be more inline with existing terminology of other flags.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-feb40e0f068c299ff3a5204caad0c3834bf0b9c9/> clarify different repository types much better
 - <csr-id-79e37f5a53802f4f2499d426856d0ea0d316599d/> Remove --no-multi-crate-release support entirely
   As the default is to do multi-crate releases and now having to deal
   with single-create releases reduces maintenance burden.
   
   The solution to this problem is to not specify versions in
   dev-dependencies to workspace crates.
   
   We also don't check for this anymore, which might be re-added
   at some point if there is demand.
 - <csr-id-96fd2c1b2db3ba7959a97d212f64ac0ed7184132/> Use 'to_*' when converting `easy::Object` to specific object kind
   This also makes the API more consistent while being more idiomatic.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-963798af8339ee3d1278aea3c2abca26e1a674c1/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-afa0a50d51f3e15186c5fac7ee817d169fc989cb/> upgrade to crates-index 0.18
   It now assumes that the crates-index must exist, which migth not always
   be the case and rightfully so. Now we wrap it to get back to the
   original behavior.
 - <csr-id-338eb4b53da0c00d810a6a154d4ea7fe48536a5c/> rename --skip-* flags to --no-* for consistency

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9bc4049fc3babeef1a4a5b3804dcb8eb4877000e/> Remove easy::borrow::Error entirely; support for multiple objects per handle
   This massive simplification finally allows any amounts of objects to be
   created while adding support for reusing their data buffers thanks
   to a simple free-list stored with the handle.
 - <csr-id-d000e81d054fba5d75d5e6cdc338d295c6553725/> rename `easy::Object` to `OwnedObject`; remove `Ref` suffix from `ObjectRef` and `TreeRef`
 - <csr-id-4d4cb23503e9bc0e8c9a0ac80217e23e87afbd0e/> 'changelog' subcommand change --dependencies to --no-dependencies
   This makes dependency resolution similar to cargo smart-release by
   default and is less surprising.
 - <csr-id-eaca66c77fbdf2f0db7eaf5e03edb316b1a9ae95/> Remove `--only` alias and invert `--no-dependencies` to `--dependencies`
   This leads to easier usage in the common case and helps avoid confusion
   when --dependencies is used and it's not picking up safety bumps on the
   way, like `smart-release` would.
 - <csr-id-5a3bbcb4496f5bfcc624b6f9e967af0d63ac2ed3/> rename short name for `--execute` to `-e` from `-n` for consistency

   This one also contains the first and probably only test for tag object

   The problem here is that even though we can turn non-publishable breaks
   into publishable ones without loosing information, they will not be in

   weird logic.

   is then used for prefix matching file names within that directory.

 - <csr-id-84aeb51fd6099d8cfa6ec4db08b78e06728d0664/> rename tracking for crates in the crate-root.
   Now it's possible to rename crates if they are directly at the crate root
   without loosing their history.

   if manifests are edited by hand, which is not the common case.
   
   If it is, please let us know.
 - <csr-id-0d203345367e28823f05ed1f8dbf26d47d04d6d6/> 'changelog' understands '-e/--execute' as well.
   This makes writing changelogs before release easier as the command-line
   has to change less.
 - <csr-id-48a2dcca9de7ef243d8d7990ca0e7f7cdd3360a8/> Support for no prefixes in version headers
   These are also inherited so once set by a single versioned release
   section, fully generated sections will inherit their prefix from
   that one.
 - <csr-id-eab7fbe00a99f70c1af048278464f6416543d485/> Add `-d` short flag for `--allow-dirty` in `changelog`

   Note the duplication the method name using traits, which seems like a good solution
   to the problem of differentiating tag objects and tag references while
   keeping the method name short.
   
   Most will only ever need one, right?
   
   Even in my example that's not the case, so maybe we have to rename it.

   statistics.
   
   Note that it's always possible to delete individual sections afterwards.
 - <csr-id-afe692af21a53f02e9ecefca64ba2caad8b21791/> changelog command learns the --without <section> option

   Previously, if worktree crates would also be used as crates.io crates,

   Previously it was possible see a crate was changed, but didn't receive a

   The issue was an algorithm inabuility to find changes in the commitgraph

   breakage-propagation to fail which led the crate to be ignored entirely
   even when their dependees changed their version. This led to
   inconsistent version requirements which would abort any cargo call.
 - <csr-id-7634f69f76480a0b76a58e3565f27d925d8fd844/> improve headline parsing for git-conventional messages.
   It is now case-insensitive, which prevents it from getting tripped
   up in some cases.
 - <csr-id-ff553150c9a0195e0e561c3f75e96b5d4c27651a/> Don't pass judgement on usefulness of certain kinds of git-conventional messages
   Previously we would intentionally avoid writing out information about
   refactors or chores as they are not deemed useful in a changelog.
   
   However, this can be confusing for anyone but the original author.
   
   We now write them as seen.
   
   Future iterations on this may consider adding more options
   to configure which sections should go into the changelog.
 - <csr-id-f90a34eb131a7a56f0c7d513b13ae85fab69dcac/> more prominent message if 'bat' wasn't found in PATH
 - <csr-id-66c33aa691d8de288fe01355398390cb72d46be6/> don't claim missing user edits if there are some
 - <csr-id-57316bb060571ab41ecdc99854091676b3bcd3f9/> don't mistake prefixed tags for versions
   Previously we would be too generious when accepting version tags, now
   we accept the prefixes 'v' and 'vers' and no prefix at all.
 - <csr-id-1829e1ce2998d1e625b589554db463f6fef1d0d2/> don't panic if there is a version requirement without version
 - <csr-id-bfb6b5fe9ff34c6882eb57c47099bb729f941b85/> Don't let dev-dependencies participate in traversal unless they have a version specified.
   This prevents safety bumps due to breaking changes in dev dependencies,
   which are generally ignored if there is no version specified.
 - <csr-id-d078b9a7f51c1665c67ab728a4180d1df7798c76/> nicer previews thanks to added newline
 - <csr-id-a53631473201cd7914da78c037cfbf2767c0c1fd/> Assume manifests cannot necessarily be read by `cargo_toml::Manifest` and fallback
 - <csr-id-510cd12ab2001f4c1ef6fadd669a3d1416039f92/> create github release only after tags were created and pushed
 - <csr-id-ffd0561cab8fcdb8b36bd5d88bed4054c14727b5/> strip `.git` suffix from repository paths when using it in urls
 - <csr-id-0b077c0e12cf2edb7e5a3b49116ccbeee1fa18ec/> remove extra '/' after https://github.com/ based URLs
 - <csr-id-d1d4961e840cc60dfbf8553e57fd2410d0238374/> push all available tags even if an error occurred
   That way, tags don't remain unpushed despite having been created
   successfully, just because one crate later in the publishing
   process fails.
 - <csr-id-7dec0c7969c1afb5203fcab036e23e972ff59dc7/> create GitHub release right after publishing succeeds
   This is more atomic and prevents loosing all github releases if one
   publish fails later on.
 - <csr-id-2d234c5794b4d730d1eb12d9921653213100f84d/> src/ dir of root packages is only used if there is multiple workspace members
 - <csr-id-7f3d3890264a0425c8e9221b16e9e048fef05fb5/> correct reporting of manifest changes
   Previously even unchanged crates would trigger workspace crates
   to be recorded for manifest changes.
   
   Now only crates that are to receive manifest changes will be triggering
   this.
 - <csr-id-0cbceee0f53aa10f06a1d23951be3c7e863f568d/> panic due to unexpected internal state
   When there was no change in the src/ directory of the top-level crate,
   the dependency resolution would not be able to auto-bump the version
   as no change occurred, but another part would usually detect a change
   as it wasn't confined to the top-level src/ directory.
   
   This could lead to a panic as an invariant wasn't upheld.
   
   This was fixed by letting both parts agree to use the src/ directory
   to determine changes of the top-level directory, and by making panics
   impossible while improving the messaging around this state should it
   still occur. The latter is rough, probably rare, but usable.
 - <csr-id-f63303d41db48a858252e9a395b82019dad8a883/> dependency resolution
   Previously the ordering of crate for release might not have been
   correct due to this issue that is now fixed.
   
   We need depth-first traversals and previously it would extend skipped
   dependencies, effectively putting them into their own ordering.
   
   Previously it would restore that ordering, but not anymore, causing
   this bug that was entirely unnecessary.
 - <csr-id-aa5fbb849d23826eda484900dc110b55b8a29c8b/> --no-changelog during smart-release is now actually working
   Previously the flag had no effect and changelogs would always be
   generated, possibly stopping the release as at least one of them
   needed manual work.
 - <csr-id-730bcf7b64b9efa4b6871752cc389363132ebec1/> pin version of clap to beta 5
   This assures we don't get broken automatically in future.
   Previously that wasn't possible as the dependency of `clap`,
   `clap-derive` was also using a beta verion and wasn't constrained,
   hence it would be updated and cause breaking changes with pinned
   versions of consumers of `clap`.
 - <csr-id-44aff86eaaf481c7b3079a12782db817e19848f0/> ! breaking changes cause intermediate (otherwise skipped) crates to be published.
   This assures that about-to-be-released crates that have breaking changes
   anywhere in their dependency graph will cause all crates leading up to,
   and including, a breaking change to be published as well.
 - <csr-id-d504df3b8ed0439226b659ca9bfdc55adc0506b2/> don't claim to change manifest version if it's the same one

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-39bcb1d1b2ea4cc9a75f97bc05db642b0a556f8d/> don't auto-publish stable crates by inverting `no-auto-publish-of-stable-crates` (to `auto-publish...`).
   It turned out that I was happily publishing stable crates even without user-facing changes
   as this was the default.
   This will now stop, and is fine if stable crates are not exposing API of unstable crates.
 - <csr-id-018bb93d253d1649c736d54609aa9b2c1f33296d/> don't auto-publish stable crates by inverting `no-auto-publish-of-stable-crates` (to `auto-publish...`).

</details>

## 0.19.0 (2023-04-27)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-00471ae75464ee14b93480b016858b6606e0b194/> avoid panics in favor of error handling. That way more information can be provided which helps with a fix.

## 0.18.0 (2023-04-27)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-cc48c35d0ecf35824910c5b6ecc62fe9b2aff1b5/> fix minor typos

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d1bd513f27e17787eb223f7b0521f954c518153e/> $HOME detection on windows

## 0.17.0 (2023-02-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-eee22110b7f0f3e4765043e4acc9c832c2b86549/> capitalize the first letter of reproduced commit messages.
   That way they look more consistent with the rest of the text, which typically
   is capitalized as well.

## 0.16.1 (2023-02-17)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-fe58a79edde7d916ce72badc40204c507d015ebf/> enable local-offset support in the `time` crate and opt-in to it.
   This should allow proper times for release dates like before as they
   respect the local time, instead of defaulting to UTC-time.

## 0.16.0 (2023-02-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cd1202388b1cd290211c2f9580d2acbdd82384f9/> rename tracking for crates in the crate-root.
   Now it's possible to rename crates if they are directly at the crate root
   without loosing their history.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-35a1df715e1e8e28fb98237908c964ddbb8981fa/> assure we can track dependencies correctly.
   Previously, if worktree crates would also be used as crates.io crates,
   the dependency traversal would fail to find packages that come in from crates.io
   as opposed to the workspace, and discard them, causing dependencies to be missed.
   
   Now we correctly ignore workspace dependencies from crates.io.

## 0.15.0 (2023-02-09)

<csr-id-63969671df60b4e07e2d7d671c657639d055b0b8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-63969671df60b4e07e2d7d671c657639d055b0b8/> upgrade to clap 4.1

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-dc580414cbc7593c3ccf257f1f62d7323a3a3424/> handle worktree members which are also used as dependencies from crates.io.
   Previously there would be an assertion error if worktree members
   are not used only by path, but also by dependency to crates.io.
 - <csr-id-1ce3190000f6211ce31468c7603d491bb5b90293/> Disable tag.gpgSign in test scripts
   This is done for the same reason that commit.gpgsign is disabled for test
   scripts. It prevents test failures if the user has tag.gpgsign enabled in
   their global git config when invoking tests.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.14.0 (2022-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0eca94d84bd82f2083b41acdb316edce54365f11/> `where -> were` typo fix.

## 0.13.0 (2022-10-10)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-118c19628e00dce0248ea975c5e93745c8058b5a/> build complete history information to match with `did crate changed` queries
   Previously it was possible see a crate was changed, but didn't receive a
   version bump which would in turn halt the release process.
   
   The issue was an algorithm inability to find changes in the commitgraph
   because it would not look at the correct tree, causing trees to be
   missed entirely. This in turn caused it to not see changes that were
   present and the mismatch in question.
 - <csr-id-03f3ffc0816659b03f4eb0b2f24154ab2f86b95a/> log errors if these log messages cause stopping the release process.
   Previously it was possible see `log::warn` but have the process abort
   with proclaimed errors which weren't obvious. Now they are `log::error`
   as one would expect.

## 0.12.1 (2022-08-31)

### Fix

- Use correct English in `Commit Details`, see [#513](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/513) for details.

## 0.12.0 (2022-08-30)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-fcbea050d04f0b763adef80d9de829f171dda571/> Assure `git@github.com/user/repo` urls transform into https urls correctly.

## 0.11.0 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-376749cc49c6dafcc314b8435d6feac81482b3f5/> allow dependency edits to apply to `target.<cfg>.*dependencies`.
   Previously these would be skipped, which would cause the publish to
   abort due to invalid manifests - some dependencies would still refer
   to an outdated but incompatible version.
 - <csr-id-988c61e07bdb52870794e70e94b925de7acb402e/> List any dependency update that is caused by other crates in preview.
   Previously it was possible that crates there were about to be published
   didn't show up in the list of crates that received a safety version
   bump.

## 0.10.2 (2022-05-27)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-64b951cade24c69d522a76ad217bea70a4afe45a/> Avoid running into the `default-members` trap with 'cargo publish'.
   Default-members in a cargo workspace can override what's actually
   published, so we have to be explicit about what to publish.
   
   This is only the case when there is more than one members in the
   workspace, even though it would probably work as well if the package
   would be specified with a single-crate workspace.

## 0.10.1 (2022-05-23)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-33a2bd6bd3faf597f020924e42082a714d3253b9/> Correctly determine top-level crate name.
   Previously it was possible to think the crate is part of a multi-crate
   worktree even though it wasn't, causing changelogs to not pick up their
   history as it would look for different tag names.

## 0.10.0 (2022-05-21)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-fcaa6353297fd1d4cb30ca3a873f76efb62e45e1/> Don't assume crates are non-breaking just because they are in the user selection.
   Crates showing up 'early' in our list could cause the entire
   breakage-propagation to fail which led the crate to be ignored entirely
   even when their dependees changed their version. This led to
   inconsistent version requirements which would abort any cargo call.

## 0.9.0 (2022-04-03)

<csr-id-51d1c686763b4c036ec2c3c15d7c3ebb48e208de/>
<csr-id-bbc6efeceb26050973e1425e68a52e51b9df4572/>

A quality-of-life release which should make publishing of inter-dependent crates much more reliable.

### New Features

 - Wait for previously published crates explicitly to avoid running into publish failures due to the previously published crate not present 
   even after 3 attempts.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-f9daba439e2d669c8b0a6bcac9ff50cbf9d80371/> improve headline parsing for git-conventional messages.
   
   It is now case-insensitive, which prevents it from getting tripped
   up in some cases.
 - <csr-id-1feb118e87f302d030ceca03ce8f8c22d40d7f03/> Don't pass judgement on usefulness of certain kinds of git-conventional messages.
   
   Previously we would intentionally avoid writing out information about
   refactors or chores as they are not deemed useful in a changelog.
   
   However, this can be confusing for anyone but the original author.
   
   We now write them as seen.
   
   Future iterations on this may consider adding more options
   to configure which sections should go into the changelog.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bbc6efeceb26050973e1425e68a52e51b9df4572/> clarify different repository types much better

## 0.8.4 (2021-09-10)

## 0.8.0 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-a3caf3938bf0f1cea1bee0f55c082062dd250bed/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-a3caf3938bf0f1cea1bee0f55c082062dd250bed/> upgrade all dependencies

### New Features

 - <csr-id-51d1c686763b4c036ec2c3c15d7c3ebb48e208de/> highlight (non-fatal) errors when losslessly parsing changelogs
 - <csr-id-4843b7bdcb1b05e2b99e199e168665be07123846/> Commit statistics reveal the days passes between releases

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9c1e38bfcffea372f06c78a44b2abc2284b7a87e/> more prominent message if 'bat' wasn't found in PATH

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c4184f3c31ffc4597bd089e8140653906a6594d8/> Remove easy::borrow::Error entirely; support for multiple objects per handle
   This massive simplification finally allows any amounts of objects to be
   created while adding support for reusing their data buffers thanks
   to a simple free-list stored with the handle.
 - <csr-id-880b56426859306aa30038ff35e2ad14607e9e90/> rename `easy::Object` to `OwnedObject`; remove `Ref` suffix from `ObjectRef` and `TreeRef`

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-15e60b2d80e4452a316d14f938583b23fb9e17e6/> upgrade to crates-index 0.18
   It now assumes that the crates-index must exist, which might not always
   be the case and rightfully so. Now we wrap it to get back to the
   original behavior.

## 0.7.0 (2021-11-29)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-f4421d83d022a56e47f534a8c676bcb9cb3d230d/> don't mistake prefixed tags for versions
   Previously we would be too generous when accepting version tags, now
   we accept the prefixes 'v' and 'vers' and no prefix at all.
 - <csr-id-6eae7f1119e2a7928286f233fc397b92274bb0ab/> don't panic if there is a version requirement without version
 - <csr-id-b12b76c93db43044d6976ae218c11a8f3f3cd81d/> don't claim missing user edits if there are some

## 0.6.0 (2021-11-16)

<csr-id-82075e8a101adb2fda0c11e6567e2148d2e66b8f/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-82075e8a101adb2fda0c11e6567e2148d2e66b8f/> try to auto-update crates index with lifetime craziness
   Even though it could work, it's too complicated.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-aafb0550222aab97b52c8d716c506709b6720d3f/> auto-update crates-index if there is an indication
   There is the possibility of false-positives triggering such an update
   if manifests are edited by hand, which is not the common case.
   
   If it is, please let us know.
 - <csr-id-a4a53765952729d4ad59d8adcd3ce66c4c71589f/> 'changelog' understands '-e/--execute' as well.
   This makes writing changelogs before release easier as the command-line
   has to change less.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-57a50a68313cee4c63b1c32f3dedb2837bb751fc/> Don't let dev-dependencies participate in traversal unless they have a version specified.
   This prevents safety bumps due to breaking changes in dev dependencies,
   which are generally ignored if there is no version specified.

## 0.5.6 (2021-10-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ff2c07acea56eeed679dfbe59b5ab1d4baa45d42/> nicer previews thanks to added newline

## 0.5.5 (2021-10-20)

The `v` prefix is not enforced anymore and is handled depending on what's already present.

This helps to handle changelogs with slightly different styles as well.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3613a95d730d0aeef87d9c256f93bd528d4945bb/> Support for lack of prefixes in version headers.
   
   These are also inherited so once set by a single versioned release
   section, fully generated sections will inherit their prefix from
   that one.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9d0d1fd71196b129b229a7d9475fdd6b99e8675b/> Assume manifests cannot necessarily be read by `cargo_toml::Manifest` and fallback.
   
   This prevents errors to occur in some configurations when no crate is specified on the command-line.

## v0.5.4 (2021-10-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-77f433e806e43c8d355b3e176ed740ba4de9777c/> create github release only after tags were created and pushed

## v0.5.3 (2021-10-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-a3aaa3e0fa38085530bc20443de176306fc8d5d2/> strip `.git` suffix from repository paths when using it in urls
 - <csr-id-53ee1a751e5d79aa3e325a5fd3c3a211fc3d06a1/> remove extra '/' after https://github.com/ based URLs

## v0.5.2 (2021-10-19)

Releases will be more atomic and it will try hard to complete all pending operations even in the light
of failure. Now GitHub releases will be created right after a publish succeeded, and tags will be pushed
for all successful publishes.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-db3cb11c466fff57f3f272d7269dc95a636e1c1f/> Add `-d` short flag for `--allow-dirty` in `changelog`

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8c3ca9cf58c44af627fc9b3c4138891635b1c554/> Push all available tags even if an error occurred.
   
   That way, tags don't remain unpushed despite having been created
   successfully, just because one crate later in the publishing
   process fails.
 - <csr-id-b769c47079a16042ef592a0199cb2d0f6afeeb5e/> Create GitHub release right after publishing succeeds.
   
   This is more atomic and prevents loosing all github releases if one
   publish fails later on.
 - <csr-id-ae8570050a313457bb2fd6659e31f34fd29bc325/> `src/` dir of root packages is only used if there is multiple workspace members.
   
   Otherwise one part of the dependency resolver might have concluded that there are changes, while another part would not have.
   The outcome would have been the same, but the messaging around it would have been different unnecessarily.

## v0.5.1 (2021-10-19)

This release contains an important bugfix which may have caused panics when the root-package didn't have changes.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ed8abfdac40f5c8b17981b8a990572f6f07c8862/> `changelog` subcommand fails if there is nothing to do

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ce68733379a8ab4644c849ba1571bc7063962c64/> Fix panic due to unexpected internal state.
   
   When there was no change in the src/ directory of the top-level crate,
   the dependency resolution would not be able to auto-bump the version
   as no change occurred, but another part would usually detect a change
   as it wasn't confined to the top-level src/ directory.
   
   This could lead to a panic as an invariant wasn't upheld.
   
   This was fixed by letting both parts agree to use the src/ directory
   to determine changes of the top-level directory, and by making panics
   impossible while improving the messaging around this state should it
   still occur. The latter is rough, probably rare, but usable.
 - <csr-id-6ee4f5d20c832a54ca5d841773d93f0927a16f25/> Correct the reporting of manifest changes.
   
   Previously even unchanged crates would trigger workspace crates
   to be recorded for manifest changes.
   
   Now only crates that are to receive manifest changes will be triggering
   this.

## v0.5.0 (2021-10-19)

<csr-id-07372dd045de88f283d35d8f3dcc4c079dce88e9/>
<csr-id-3519f9a1f4002232aec752dadf7d3737bd97ce3d/>

A release with breaking changes as the dependency engine was reworked to handle even more cases
and make future improvements easier.

### Other

 - <csr-id-3519f9a1f4002232aec752dadf7d3737bd97ce3d/> try to assure that breaking changes are always published in correct order
   The problem here is that even though we can turn non-publishable breaks
   into publishable ones without loosing information, they will not be in
   the correct order.
   
   The solution is to merge dependency trees instead of clearing them with
   weird logic.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6d4edfa3b2d2c6700e0956716a575831b940cb50/> Respect `publish=false` in cargo manifest
 - <csr-id-7648bf3c7554352bec8e1355f9b593d891b2b17f/> Perform safety bumps without forcing a publish.
   
   This is what's required to assure that future publishes of such
   transitively dependent crates won't cause downstream breakage the next time the tool is run.
 - <csr-id-b806a9c982da1e5ff42c268e430c67363f3a7918/> Inform about safety bumps more explicitly,
   and generally greatly improve the way the course of action is described.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-501c1d102c0e5e4635120bb1aa857e97a2b537b4/> Dependency resolution.
   
   Previously the ordering of crates for release might not have been
   correct due to this issue that is now fixed.
   
   We need depth-first traversals and previously it would extend skipped
   dependencies, effectively putting them into their own ordering.
   
   Previously it would restore that ordering, but not anymore, causing
   this bug that was entirely unnecessary.
 - <csr-id-5e98e5559707cf308e2cd64494fe73a99f9e9c8e/> `--no-changelog` during smart-release is now actually working
   
   Previously the flag had no effect and changelogs would always be
   generated, possibly stopping the release as at least one of them
   needed manual work.
 - <csr-id-dfc588b25ede3faa578eb8e131e73c857117a6df/> Pin version of clap to beta 5.
   
   This assures we don't get broken automatically in future.
   Previously that wasn't possible as the dependency of `clap`,
   `clap-derive` was also using a beta version and wasn't constrained,
   hence it would be updated and cause breaking changes with pinned
   versions of consumers of `clap`.
 - <csr-id-fb6b909e49d8428e53da6e2ce3c2f878025e00f7/> ! breaking changes cause intermediate (otherwise skipped) crates to be published.
   This assures that about-to-be-released crates that have breaking changes
   anywhere in their dependency graph will cause all crates leading up to,
   and including, a breaking change to be published as well.

### Changed (BREAKING)

<csr-id-2f87196217a6e685dc447b4af091842926aed6d0/>

 - <csr-id-59302ae24db791988c22322c2c1ad72e2918f89a/> `changelog` subcommand inverts `--dependencies` to `--no-dependencies`
 - Remove `--no-multi-crate-release` support entirely
  
   As the default is to do multi-crate releases and now having to deal
   with single-create releases reduces maintenance burden.

   The solution to this problem is to not specify version constraints in
   dev-dependencies to workspace crates.

   We also don't check for this anymore, which might be re-added
   at some point if there is demand.This makes dependency resolution similar to cargo smart-release by default and is less surprising.

This major release adds **changelog** support to automatically generate scaffolding to be filled in by hand. The feature is driven by
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) messages which are used sparingly to mark important changes only.
Furthermore, it will deduce the require version bump, i.e. patch, minor or major, automatically by looking at the commit history
and interpreting _'conventional commit'_ messages. This means that from time to time one would sprinkle in a specifically formatted
commit message to leave enough information to determine the correct release version and create changelog scaffolding.

If you have 10 minutes, the following video gives the whirlwind tour through the new features (_and note that all issues discovered there
have been fixed :)_).

If you have 30 minutes, there is also [a long version of the video](https://youtu.be/a4CzzxJ7ecE).

And there is another one showing `cargo smart-release` releasing `gitoxide 0.9.0`, along with some explanation on how it works.

   Previously it was expected for the prefix `Path` to always exist for
   the prefix to be valid. This, however, is not similar to packed
   prefixes, which allow non-dir prefixes as well.
   
   Now we will check if the prefix is actually a directory, and if not
   split it into its parent directory and the filename portion. The latter
   is then used for prefix matching file names within that directory.

   that aren't directories, but contain a partial file.
   
   This is more like a bug to be fixed, as that works naturally for

### Changelog Support in `cargo smart-release`

When using `cargo smart-release` in dry-run mode (_default_), additional information regarding changelog will be printed.
This informs you a release would be attempted, or if manual adjustments to the changelogs would be required, for example as
they are fully generated with statistical information only.

If there is no issue with the initial changelogs, passing the `--execute` flag will write the changelogs after
providing them to you for preview (using `bat`) for a last chance to abort the operation. Otherwise the publishing
will proceed, which includes the creation of tag objects containing the relevant section of the changelog, along with
a GitHub release which is annotated with the same section (_only if the repository is hosted on GitHub_).

If there are issues to be corrected, there will be suggestions to run `cargo changelog --write --only <crate-name>`
one by one, or the release operation will have left a single commit with all changelogs written out.
In any case, it's recommended to re-write the changelog after editing to assure it is indeed stable and won't change each time
the generator is run.

For more information, run `cargo smart-release -h`.

### The `cargo changelog` Sub-Command

This new sub-command sports the same dependency resolution as `smart-release` itself, operates in dry-run mode by default
to preview changelogs that would be written. Use the `--write` flag to actually write changes to disk.

It's primary use is to conveniently generate changelogs from time to time to add the final polish by hand before
actually releasing them along with the crate with `smart-release`.

For more information, run `cargo changelog -h`.

### Other BREAKING Changes

- renamed `--skip-*` flags to `--no-*` for consistency
- rename `--skip-dependencies` to `--no-dependencies` to be more inline with existing terminology of other flags.
- rename short name for `--execute` to `-e` from `-n` for consistency

### Other Changes

 - <csr-id-e668bf23ddba9a676a885f1f401d2d2885784eef/> `--no-dependencies` now has `--only` as alias

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-11eebdcc572a72b2e66a9db3cae0a01f12a81619/> Previously it might have been possible to see that it won't use a 'new' crate version as it's already in the manifest, _even_ if these are the same. This is now fixed.
